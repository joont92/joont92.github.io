### 본문
> **Jimmy** :  
You have unusual name.  
I knew you were coming, and I spelt it wrong, but I thought it was right.  
I spelt "ie" insted of "ei".  
Is there proper way to spell it?  

> **Keira** :  
Yeah.. that's a... well... yes.  
My mom spelt it wrong.  

> **Jimmy** :  
 I thoungt I was right.  

> **Keira** :  
On my birth certificate.  
I'm half named after a Russian ice skater that my dad fancied,  
and half is Celtic name, because my mom is Scottish, so she wanted that.  
Anyway, my mom went along to the place... where do you do the birth certificate?  
I need to learn this as well.. don't I?  

> **Jimmy** :  
Oh yeah, they'll do it at the hostpital. You don't have to go anywhere.  

> **Keira** :  
Anyway, she did the birth certificate, and showed it to my father,  
and he was like,  
"You've spelt her fucking name wrong!!".  
It's not a surprise I'm dyslexic. Is it?  
I had no change from the beginning...  

> **Jimmy** :  
I guess you can't really spell a name wrong, can you?  
I mean, it's whatever is it.

> **Keira** :  
She did thought, she really did it.  
It should be "ie", but it isn't.  

> **Jimmy** :  
It's not to late.

> **Keira** :  
I should change it.

> **Jimmy** :  
You should spell your son or daughter's name wrong.

> **Keira** :  
My kid's name? OK, I'll do that.

> **Jimmy** :  
Yeah, do something that will haunt them for the rest of their life.

> **Keira** :  
OK. exactly.
