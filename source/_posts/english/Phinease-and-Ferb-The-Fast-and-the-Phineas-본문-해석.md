So Ferb, what should we do today?  
I mean, **`besides` `giving Perry a bath`.**  
> 그래서 Ferb, 우리 오늘 뭐해야할까?  
> 내 말은, Perry `목욕시키는 것` `외에`.  

What is that wonderful noise?  
> 이게 무슨 아름다운 소리지?  

Awesome!  
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!

What are you doing to mom's car!!

We `tricked it out`!  
> 차를 `치장했어(꾸몄어)`!  

**You don't even know how to drive.**  
> 너희 운전할줄도 모르잖아  

Well, duh.  
**That's why Ferb built this remote.**  
> 글쎄

Bubule, how good to see you.  
**What a `coincidence`**, Do you know your mom is here?
