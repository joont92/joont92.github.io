So Ferb, what should we do today?  
I mean, **`besides` `giving Perry a bath`.**  
> 그래서 Ferb, 우리 오늘 뭐해야할까?  
> 내 말은, Perry `목욕시키는 것` `외에`.  

What is that wonderful noise?  
> 이게 무슨 아름다운 소리지?  

Awesome!  
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!  
> 멋지다!  
> Ferb, 난 우리가 오늘 뭐해야할지 알았어!  

I've got to take a new picture myself for my blog.  
**I didn't realize mine is already `a week old`.**  
> 블로그를 위해 새 사진을 직접 찍어야해.  
> 내께 일주일이나 됬다는 걸 알아차리지 못했네  
>> a week old : 일주일 된  
>> It was only a week old.  
>> This paper's a week old.  
>> three five-week-old lion cubs.  

That's better.  
> 더 낫네.  

What are you doing to mom's car!!  
> 너희 엄마 차에 뭐하는거야!!  

We `tricked it out`!  
> 차를 `치장했어(꾸몄어)`!  

**You don't even know how to drive.**  
> 너희 운전할줄도 모르잖아  

Well, duh.  
**That's why Ferb built this remote.**  
> 글쎄  
> 그게 Ferb가 이 리모컨을 만든 이유지  

Oh.. `you're so busted`!  
> `너희 딱 걸렸어`  

Mom~ mom~ mom~ mom~  
Hmm, where's mom?  
> 엄마~ 엄마~ 엄마~ 엄마~  
> 음.. 엄마 어딨어?  

She's playing bridge at Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro's!  
> Garcia-Shapiro 부인 집에서 브릿지 하고 있어  

Heh, they won't get away with it this time!  
> 후후, 이번에는 그들이 빠져나가지 못할거야!  

Oh, Candace, dear.  
Bubule, how good to see you.  
**What a `coincidence`**, Do you know your mom is here?  
> 오 Candace  
> 만나서 반갑구나.  
> 완전 `우연의 일치`인데, 너희 엄마 여기 있는거 알고있니?  
    
I do Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro.  
**I need to talk to her `if you don't mind`.**  
> 내 알아요 Garcia-Shapiro 부인.  
> `괜찮으시다면` 그녀랑 얘기좀 할게요.  

Oi bey, **look how tall you are now.**  
**You must've grown a couple of inchies since last time I saw you.**

That was last week, Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro.  

Well, your mom's inside, dear.  
Where are your `braces`?  
**I thought you were wearing braces.**  
> `교정기` 

Yeah, mom! Mom! Mom!  

What is it Candace?  

You've got to see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!  

Hey, Ferb. What's the red button for?  

Mom!!!!!!!!!  

What is it?  
**What do you want me to see?**  
>> A가 ~ 하기를  

Quick!!  

Hi, mom~  

Hi, boys~  
Well, **if that's all I'll just be getting back to the game.**  

**Good thing we've `beefed up` the `suspension`.**
