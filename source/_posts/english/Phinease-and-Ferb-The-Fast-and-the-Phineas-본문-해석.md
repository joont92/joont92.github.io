So Ferb, what should we do today?  
I mean, **`besides` `giving Perry a bath`.**

> 내 말은, Perry `목욕시키는 것` `외에`.  

What is that wonderful noise?

Well, duh.  
**That's why Ferb built this remote.**

Oi bey, **look how tall you are now.**  
**You must've grown a couple of inchies since last time I saw you.**

Alright, alright, Candace.  
**`This better be good.`**  
> 그래, 그래, Candae.

Okay, just a second.  
> 알았어, 잠시만 기다려  

Are you `embarrassed about` flanking? itching? peeling?

**Is there something you're trying to tell me?**  
> flanking, itching, peeling에 `당황하셨나요`?  
> Candace, 이건 `비듬` 광고네.

# 3회차  
Okay, Ferb. Are we good to go?  

`And with the race about to start`, here's the Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated `blimp`!!  
> `그리고 경기가 시작되려고 하는 가운데`, `소형 비행선`  

Ah, Perry the platypus. I'm glad to here.  
Actually, I was just `getting ready` to _serve some PLATYPUS UNDER GLASS!!_  
> 사실, 난 방금 제공할 `준비를 하고 있었어`  

You're just in time to witness my latest invention my Deflate-inator Ray!  
> 넌 내 최근 발명품을 `목격하기` 위해 때마침 잘 왔네  

Which I will demonstrate, by deflating all the tires of the Jefferson County Motor Speedway!  
> 난 Jefferson County Motor Speedway의 모든 타이어의 공기를 빼면서 이것을 증명하겠다!  

After which, I will deflate everything in the `Tri-State Area`!  
> `3개 주에 걸치는 지역`  

That way, if anyone wants anything flated, they will have to talk to me!    

Phineas, you're in a big trouble  

Candace, you've got a little...  

Smile!  

Souvenir picture? Only a dollar.  

Wait a second!  

Hey!  

Now I gotcha!  

Hey `Missy`, two pictures, two `buck`s.  
> `아가씨`, `달러`  

Oh, yeah, uh, I've only got a dollar, but uh, I just want the one.  

You can just tear the other one up, okay?  

**I've got 'em**, NOW!  

And on the fast on the inside lane is Number 42, Team Phineas!  

Hey, Ferb. Do you think we can get any more power?  

I mean, I know it's just a battery.
But I was thinking, let's open it up and see what this puppy can-  
Uh, Ferb? We're actually slowing down now.  

Ferb? Hello?  
OH YEAH! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!  

Hey, Ferb. We should bring Phineas in for a pit stop.  

All right, Fireside Girls, let's move, move move!  

That helmet looks so `manly`.  
> `남자다운`  

Thanks.  

Hit it, Ferb.  

I'm so proud of you girls.
And the bow was a nice touch, Gretchen.  

Listen to those fools, as they worship their candy-colored race car man.
How about a little demonstration of my deflationary prowess?  

I got it!  

The Team Phineas car is avoiding every `obstacle`!  
**It's like he can see the whole darn track at once!**  

# 4회차  
Go Phineas! Go, Phineas. Gi Phineas! Go, Phineas.  

OH YEAH!!!  

We'are okay!!  

Well, mom. What do you think of this?  

You've looked better.  

Hmm? What do you mean?  

Already they fear me, listen to this scream! Huh?  

**Imagine the `mayhem` `once` my Deflate-inator ray is fully changed.**  
> `난장판` `~할 때`  
>> ~ 할 때 에서 딱히 1번 이라는 뜻을 담고 있지는 않은 듯 하다  

Run! Run like the wind, my little `indentured` `redent`!  

And I will give you some cheese~  

**Heh, I know I had some around here somewhere.**  
> 그게 돌아오는걸 봤어야했는데  

And mom! You've gotta believe me!  
>> [you gotta와 you've gotta는 차이가 없다](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/229693/i-gotta-go-or-ive-gotta-go)  
>> `you've gotta`가 정확한 표현이고, `you gotta`는 slang이다.

Wait a minute, **I bet it's still on TV.**  

That's good Candace.    

And look at this amazing Phineas!  

M-m-mom-mom, quick! Come look-look-look-look-look!!  

Alright, I'm coming.  

Oh, no! **A blimp is about to hit the broadcasting tower!**  

Uh-huh?  

Meap.  

Deal me back in, `Viv`.  
>> A silly, funny, pretty, unique girl with a nice heart. Also a good nickname for vivienne.  

Hmm, looks like we're walking.  

"Why don't you go back home, Candace?"  
**"I'm busy with my bridge game, Candace."**  
**She has no iead!**  

Huh? **Gotcha!**  

MOM!MOM!MOM!MOM!MOM!  

Oh, Candace, hello.  
I can't believe you've grown so much, it's unbelievable..  

Mom, you've gotta see this!  
It's about your car!  

Alright.  

Come on, come on, come on!  

Candace, you're `wearing out` the hills of my shoes.  
> `닳다`

See, mom. Look look! I told you!  

Huh!  
But.. who did this?  

Phineas and Ferb.  

You mean..  

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

They wash my car!  

Yeah!  
No, what?  

It's beautiful. I gotta `admit`.  
**I thought you were `exaggerating` a bit,** 
**but this is really worth getting excited about!**  
> `인정하다` `과장하다`  
> 그러나 이것은 흥분할 가치가 있어!  

Hi, mom. We're home.  

Hi, boys.  

I saw what you did today.  

Yeah? **How'd you like it?**  
> 'd가 뭐의 약자지?  
> would를 쓰면 어떻게 해 드릴까요? 기분이 어떻겠니? 가 된다  

I loved it!  
Now who wants some snacks?  

Thanks, mom!  

Honey, close your mouth.
