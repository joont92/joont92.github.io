So Ferb, what should we do today?  
I mean, **`besides` `giving Perry a bath`.**  
> 그래서 Ferb, 우리 오늘 뭐해야할까?  
> 내 말은, Perry `목욕시키는 것` `외에`.  

What is that wonderful noise?  
> 이게 무슨 아름다운 소리지?  

Awesome!  
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!  
> 멋지다!  
> Ferb, 난 우리가 오늘 뭐해야할지 알았어!  

I've got to take a new picture myself for my blog.  
**I didn't realize mine is already `a week old`.**  
> 블로그를 위해 새 사진을 직접 찍어야해.  
> 내께 일주일이나 됬다는 걸 알아차리지 못했네  
>> a week old : 일주일 된  
>> It was only a week old.  
>> This paper's a week old.  
>> three five-week-old lion cubs.  

That's better.  
> 더 낫네.  

What are you doing to mom's car!!  
> 너희 엄마 차에 뭐하는거야!!  

We `tricked it out`!  
> 차를 `치장했어(꾸몄어)`!  

**You don't even know how to drive.**  
> 너희 운전할줄도 모르잖아  

Well, duh.  
**That's why Ferb built this remote.**  
> 글쎄  
> 그게 Ferb가 이 리모컨을 만든 이유지  

Oh.. `you're so busted`!  
> `너희 딱 걸렸어`  

Mom~ mom~ mom~ mom~  
Hmm, where's mom?  
> 엄마~ 엄마~ 엄마~ 엄마~  
> 음.. 엄마 어딨어?  

She's playing bridge at Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro's!  
> Garcia-Shapiro 부인 집에서 브릿지 하고 있어  

Heh, they won't get away with it this time!  
> 후후, 이번에는 그들이 빠져나가지 못할거야!  

Oh, Candace, dear.  
Bubule, how good to see you.  
**What a `coincidence`**, Do you know your mom is here?  
> 오 Candace  
> 만나서 반갑구나.  
> 완전 `우연의 일치`인데, 너희 엄마 여기 있는거 알고있니?  
    
I do Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro.  
**I need to talk to her `if you don't mind`.**  
> 내 알아요 Garcia-Shapiro 부인.  
> `괜찮으시다면` 그녀랑 얘기좀 할게요.  

Oi bey, **look how tall you are now.**  
**You must've grown a couple of inchies since last time I saw you.**

>> 의문사에서 동사,주어 순서를 뒤집고 앞에 문장을 두는 형태  

That was last week, Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro.  

Well, your mom's inside, dear.  
Where are your `braces`?  
**I thought you were wearing braces.**  
> `교정기` 

Yeah, mom! Mom! Mom!  

What is it Candace?  

You've got to see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!  

Hey, Ferb. What's the red button for?  

Mom!!!!!!!!!  

What is it?  
**What do you want me to see?**  
>> A가 ~ 하기를  

Quick!!  

Hi, mom~  

Hi, boys~  
Well, **if that's all I'll just be getting back to the game.**  

**Good thing we've `beefed up` the `suspension`.**  
> 서스펜션을 보강한건 잘 한 일이었어.  
> `보강하다`, `서스펜션(자동차에서 차체 무게를 받쳐주는 장치)`

Woah! **What else can it do?**  

Hi, Phinease.  

Oh, hi, Isabella.  

What'cha doin?  

We're entering the Swap Oil 500 today.  

**Aren't you gonna need a pit crew?**  

Do you know pit crew?  

Well, I know a few people who work well together.  

Great, you're hired.  
See you at the track.

Hey, Ferb. Where's Perry?  

Good morning, Agent.P.  
The evil doctor doofershment is up to his all trick.  

**your mission is to `find out` why, and if necessary, put a stop to it.**  
> 알아내다  

Hi, Phinease.  
**I got your pit crew.**  

Cool, see you in the pits.  

Okay, girl.  
We're dealing with 426 cubic-inch `fully-blown` V8,  
and limited slip differential.  
> ~의 모든 특성을 갖춘, 완전히 발달한  

Would that  

Phineas! Phineas! Phineeeeeeaaaaas!!!!!  

**Hey, I can't hear the cars.**  
> 이봐, 차소리 안들려!  

Hey, Candace.  
I didn't know you were a racing fan.  

Jeremy...  
**Who me?**  
Oh, yeah! I'm a big fan of those.. those a.. that red one is cute.  

Oh, that is Billy Ray Digler's car.  
He is great.  

Yeah, he is the best.  
That Billy Roy..  

Billy Ray.  

I love it when he turns left and he turns.. left again..  

And in the thrid lane, the newcomers Team Phineas!  

...   

Yes, yes he does.  

And look, **he is already got his own screaming fans!**  

Phineas!  

Hey, Candace is `rooting for` us.  
> 응원하다  

Candace, you're on the big screen.  

Phineas!!!!!!!!!!  

And your little brother's gonna be on TV.  

Phineas? On TV?  

TV! That's it!  
They're so busted.  a
**Can you wait here for a second?**  
Tnanks.  

What is it, Candace?  
I'm right in the middle of 3-no trumps.  

Turn on the TV!!!!  

Alright, alright, Candace.  
**This better be good.**  
> 별것 없으면 가만 안둔다.별것 없기만 해봐라

Well, Well, do you see it?  

**Just a second**, honey.  

Turn on the cable box, first.  

Hmm, alright.  
Wait. 'Kay, that's not it.  

Is this one?  
No, this is another phone.  

Oh, I turn on the streo.  

Mom, hurry up!!  

Okay, just a second.  

Are you embressed about flanking? itching? peeling?  
Candace, this is dandruff commercial.  
**Is there something you're trying to tell me?**  

# 3회차  
Okay, Ferb. Are we good to go?  

`And with the race about to start`, here's the Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated `blimp`!!  
> `그리고 경기가 시작되려고 하는 가운데`, `소형 비행선`  

Ah, Perry the platypus. I'm glad to here.  
Actually, I was just `getting ready` to _serve some PLATYPUS UNDER GLASS!!_  
> 사실, 난 방금 제공할 `준비를 하고 있었어`  

You're just in time to witness my latest invention my Deflate-inator Ray!  
> 넌 내 최근 발명품을 `목격하기` 위해 때마침 잘 왔네  

Which I will demonstrate, by deflating all the tires of the Jefferson County Motor Speedway!  
> 난 Jefferson County Motor Speedway의 모든 타이어의 공기를 빼면서 이것을 증명하겠다!  

After which, I will deflate everything in the `Tri-State Area`!  
> `3개 주에 걸치는 지역`  

That way, if anyone wants anything flated, they will have to talk to me!    

Phineas, you're in a big trouble  

Candace, you've got a little...  

Smile!  

Souvenir picture? Only a dollar.  

Wait a second!  

Hey!  

Now I gotcha!  

Hey `Missy`, two pictures, two `buck`s.  
> `아가씨`, `달러`  

Oh, yeah, uh, I've only got a dollar, but uh, I just want the one.  

You can just tear the other one up, okay?  

**I've got 'em**, NOW!  

And on the fast on the inside lane is Number 42, Team Phineas!  

Hey, Ferb. Do you think we can get any more power?  

I mean, I know it's just a battery.
But I was thinking, let's open it up and see what this puppy can-  
Uh, Ferb? We're actually slowing down now.  

Ferb? Hello?  
OH YEAH! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!  

Hey, Ferb. We should bring Phineas in for a pit stop.  

All right, Fireside Girls, let's move, move move!  

That helmet looks so `manly`.  
> `남자다운`  

Thanks.  

Hit it, Ferb.  

I'm so proud of you girls.
And the bow was a nice touch, Gretchen.  

Listen to those fools, as they worship their candy-colored race car man.
How about a little demonstration of my deflationary prowess?  

I got it!  

The Team Phineas car is avoiding every obstacle!  
It's like he can see the whole darn track at once!

Go Phineas! Go, Phineas. Gi Phineas! Go, Phineas.  

OH YEAH!!!  

We'are okay!!  

Well, mom. What do you think of this?  

You've looked better.  

Hmm? What do you mean?  

Already they fear me, listen to this scream! Huh?  

**Imagine the `mayhem` `once` my Deflate-inator ray is fully changed.**  
> `난장판` `~할 때`  
>> ~ 할 때 에서 딱히 1번 이라는 뜻을 담고 있지는 않은 듯 하다  

Run! Run like the wind, my little indentured redent!  

And I will give you cheese~  

Heh, I know I had some around somewhere.  

I suppose I should've seen that coming.  
> 그게 돌아오는걸 봤어야했는데  

And mom! You gotta believe me!
