### 본문

> **Olivia** :
I don't consider us best friend. We are best friend.
The world doesn't know. because it's real friendship.
I don't just put it out on twitter and instagram.
We are really friend now.
We actually hang out, we text.

> **Ellen** :
Yeah, we do hang out and text.
But I heard the rumor that you and Aaron got engagged, and then I thought,
Well, Surely that's not true. because you wolud tell your best friend.

> **Olivia** :
That is.. you would be the first person I told.

> **Ellen** :
Aaron Rodgers. The wonderful quarterback for the Greenbay Packers Everybody.

> **Olivia** :
We're not engagged.

> **Ellen** :
Okay.

> **Olivia** :
Not engagged.
...
That's him proposing right there.

> **Ellen** :
That's him proposing?

> **Olivia** :
Yeah, they caught it, caught it right there.

> **Ellen** :
So how does something like that get started?

> **Olivia** :
It was just magazine that said it.
And everyone started going with it.
It's kind of strange.
I mean, I didn't think anybody believe this, until, like my family started texting me.
And my sister said,
"It's so stupid. Why would anybody think this?
I mean, you are not engagged. It's so stupid."
And the next text after that was
"But seriously, are you engagged? because I'm seeing it everywhere."
No, we're not engagged.

> **Ellen** :
So your mother, your mother obviously didn't believe it.

> **Olivia** :
My mother did believe this, but now I was able to correct it and she knows for sure that it's not.
As soon as I said "That's not true", she believe it.

> **Ellen** :
Let's talk about Ride Along2.
You're so funny in it, and that movie was really great. The first one was great.
And it knocked Star Wars down from the number one spot last week.
So congratulation on that.

> **Olivia** :
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

> **Ellen** :
So did you have fun? And Kavin Hart, how hilarious is he?

> **Olivia** :
Kevin Hart is...

> **Ellen** :
How do you not laugh at him constantly?

> **Olivia** :
I mean, I literally, I ruined almost every take from uncontrollable laughter.
I just, I mean I love the guy so much, he is so sweet.
And he is the tinest person I've ever met.
I mean, I'm barely 5'4', and I'm so much taller than him.

> **Ellen** :
Yeah, he's a tiny little guy and with bursting with talent.
