You have worked in two films, is that right, with Justin Timberlake?

Oh, two films with Justin, Yeah.

I call him Juh.

I don't even call him anything. because that's how close we are.  

> **Conan** :  
You don't say anything. But he know you're talking about him.  

> **Amanda** :  
It's like a nod.  

> **Conan** :  
OK. Were you.. obviously, you are in that age range. Were you a big NSYNC fan?  

> **Amanda** :  
Yeah, I was. Who wasn't? Come on.  
But I had to pretend I wasn't, thought.  
I mean, I hope he is not watching this.  
Don't tell anybody. Don't tell him.  
Yeah, I was obsessed with NSYNC.  
Are you kidding me? Look at me. I'm 26. I was perfect age.  
But he wasn't my favorite.  
I didn't even find him attractive, in fact.  

> **Conan** :  
Who was your favorite of those guys?  
Let's see.. There's a Chic, there's a Ned...  

> **Amanda** :  
You must be talking about some other boy bands.  

> **Conan** :  
I don't know. What are their names?  

> **Amanda** :  
They had a lot of names. I liked JC.  
Don't know where he is.  

> **Conan** :   
We've got some JC people here.  

> **Amanda** :  
Where is JC.. I can't even say his last name.  

> **Conan** :  
He's not here.  

> **Amanda** :  
No, I mean, I haven't seen the guys for in years.  

> **Conan** :  
You used to see him around?  
He'd just be hanging around?  

> **Amanda** :  
When I came to hollywood, you'd better believe I saw him around.  

> **Conan** :  
That sounds kind of threatening, actually.  

> **Andy** :  
It sounds like someone who has got a restraining order.  

> **Amanda** :  
Oh my God.  

> **Conan** :  
JC won't let you come near him.  

> **Amanda** :  
I wish that were my problem.
