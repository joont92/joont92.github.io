### 본문
> **Jimmy** :  
How did this unbelivable paring come to be?  
How did you two get together?  

> **Psy** :  
I called him, and I said "Can you feature on my song?"  
and he said "What is the title of the song?"  
and I said "Hangover"  
he said, "Oh, I'm doing it"  

> **Jimmy** :  
Snoop gives a lot of thought to thease things.  
He takes it under careful consideration.  

> **Psy** :  
We'd never met before, after song's done.  
I was in Asia, he was in here.  
He was doing his part in LA, I did my part in Korea.  
We were on the phone, and we did it by internet.  

> **Jimmy** :  
Unbelivable, you'd not met until you shoot the music video?  

> **Psy** :  
Not really.  

> **Jimmy** :  
Wow, and even the Snoop doesn't remember meeting you.  
...  
You went over to South Korea to shot the video.  
Was that a fun experience for you guys?  

> **Snoop** :   
For me, It was awesome.  
Because I've always wanted to be in an matial arts movie,  
and I felt like I was in Kingdom of it all.  
The stuff that he had us doing, the thing that was going aroung us,  
it felt like I was in action movie, I felt like I was a Karate star.  

> **Jimmy** :  
How long were you over there in South Korea?  

> **Psy** :  
I gotta say this, because I really felt sorry about him.  
We were spending only 18 hours shooting the video.  

> **Snoop** :  
18 hours straight. This man doesn't take a break.  

> **Psy** :  
We all know he is really diligent, right?  
Every time he wanted to take a rest, but we didn't have time.  

> **Snoop** :  
Not a rest, but a break.  

> **Jimmy** :  
Yeah, right.
