### 본문
> Well, you done done me and you bet I'm felt it.  
I'm trying to be chill but you're so hot then I melt it.  
I fell right through the cracks. I'm trying to get back.  
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest.  
Nothing gonna stop me, but divine intervention.  
I reckon it's agian my turn, to win some or learn some.  

> But I won't hasitate, no more, no more.  
It can not a wait. I'm yours.  

> And open up your mind and see like me.  
Open up your plans and damn you're free.  
And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.  
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing, we just one big family.  
And it's our God-forsaken right to be a love, love, love, love, love.  

> So I won't hasitate, no more, no more.  
It can not a wait, I'm sure.  
There is no need to complicate, our time is short.  
This is our fate, I'm yours.  

> But Do yon want to come on,  
Scooch on over closer dear.  
And I'll nibble your ears.  

> I've been spending way to long checking my tongue in the mirror.  
And bending over backwords just try to it clear.  
And my breath fogged up the glass.  
So I drew a new face and laughed.  
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason.  
To rid yourself vanatites and just go with the seasons.  
It's what we aim to do. our name is our virtue.  

> But I won't hasitate, no more, no more.  
It can not a wait. I'm yours.  

> And open up your mind and see like me.  
Open up your plans and damn you're free.  
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours.  
There's no need to complicate.  
Cause our time is short, this this this is our fate.  
I'm yours.
