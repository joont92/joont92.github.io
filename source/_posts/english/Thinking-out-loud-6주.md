### 본문
> When your legs don't walk like they used before.  
And I can't sweep you off of your feet.  
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love.  
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks.  

> And darling I will be loving you till we're 70.  
And Baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23.  
I'm thinking about how people fall in love in mysterious ways.  
Maybe just the touch a hand.  
Oh, me I fall in love with you every single day.  
I just wanna tell you I am.  

> So honey now,  
take me into your loving arms.  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.  
Place your head on my beating heart.  
I'm thinking out loud.  
Maybe we found love right where we are.  

> When my hair's over gone and my memrory fades,  
and the crowds don't remember my name.  
When my hands don't play the strings same way.  
I know you'll still love me the same.  

> Oh honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen.  
And baby your smile forever in my mind and memory.  
I'm thinking about how people for in love in mysterious ways.  
Maybe it's all part of a plan.  
I'll just keep on making the same mistake.  
Hoping that you're understand.  

> But baby now,  
take me into your loving arms.  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.  
Place your head on my beating heart.  
I'm thinking out loud.  
Maybe we found love right where we are.  

> So baby now,  
take me into your loving arms.  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.  
Place your head on my beating heart.  
I'm thinking out loud.  
Maybe we found love right where we are.  
Maybe we found love right where we are.  
We found love right where we are.
