I met my love on it..  

Oh, boy. Did that kid stink or what?  
But maybe you've got what it takes to be!  

The next super American pop teen idol star!  

Auditions open today at the Googleplex Mall in beautiful downtown Denville.  

Auditions? Today?  

Yes, today!  
At 2'o clock sharp.  

I gotta tell Stacy!  

_That_ pop start _stuff_ might be fun at first.  
But then you'd be _stuck with_ a _dead and job_.  

_Too bad you can't just do it once_ and move on.  

_Well, what_ you're talking about is _one-hit wonder_.  
> 히트곡이 하나뿐인 가수  

A one-hit wonder? What's that?  

Well, a musical act goes to the top of the charts with a `catchy` tune and meaningless lyrics.  
> 기억하기 쉬운  

I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun!  

Then they throw a big diva tentrum, lose their label, then faded to obscurity.  
> 무명으로 사라지다  

_Before they know it, the song ends up as_ elevator music.  

Here's ladies and reunion concert,  
And after that, they never sing again.  
And no one remembers them.

Not that I would know anything about that.  
> 내가 그걸 안다는건 아니고.  

A one-hit wonder  

Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.  

Stacy, what am I going to sing?!  

Hello, what are you gonna wear?  

What do you think?  

Too much.  
Too little.
Ugh, too clean.
Too dirty.
Too street.
Too goth.  

Where did you get that?  

My mom's closet.  
Do you like it?  

Nah, too retro.  
> 아니, 너무 복고풍이야.  

Perfect!  

Nice, huh?  

Yeah, you should try that on first.  

Let's go!  

Wha, meaning less done.  
How did you get to june coming alone?  

Excenllent!  
Who be done by lunch?  

Hey, where Perry go?
