# 1회차
I met my love on it..  

Oh, boy. **Did that kid stink `or what`?**  
But maybe **you've got what it takes to be 'The next super American pop teen idol star'!**  
> 맙소사, 방금 그 애 엄청 경악스러웠죠, `안 그래요`?  
> 그렇지만 당신은 아마도 '차세대 미국 십대 아이돌 스타'가 되기 위한것을 갖추었을 것입니다!  
>> Oh boy == Oh great! / Oh no! / Oh my gosh!  
>> [or what?, what it takes to be 뜻](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/190883/meaning-of-or-what-what-it-takes-to-be)  
>> or what? 은 yes가 나올 질문을 강조하고 싶을 때 사용  
>> what it takes to be 에서 끊기는게 아니라 뒤에 까지 이어짐  

> 차세대 미국 십대 아이돌 스타!  

Auditions open today at the Googleplex Mall in beautiful downtown Denville.  
> 오디션은 Denvil 시내에 있는 Googleplex 몰에서 오늘 열립니다  

Auditions? Today?  
> 오디션? 오늘?  

Yes, today!  
At 2'o clock sharp.  
> 네, 오늘요!  
> 2시 정각입니다.  

I gotta tell Stacy!  
> Stacy한테 말해야곘어!  

**That pop start `stuff` might be fun at first.**  
But then you'd be `stuck with` a `dead and job`.  
> 팝스타들의 `일`은 처음엔 재밌을지 모르지만, 나중엔 `장래성 없는 일`을 `떠맡을 수`도 있어.  
>> [may, might 차이](https://ilikeen.tistory.com/2026)  
>> 추측의 의미인데 may 보단 might를 많이 쓴다.  

**Too bad you can't just do it once and `move on`.**  
> 한번하고 `넘어갈 수` 없다는게 너무 안좋아.  
>> move on : (새로운 일, 주제로) 넘어가다  

Well, **what you're talking about is one-hit wonder.**  
> 음, 니가 말하는건 히트곡이 하나뿐인 가수네.  

A one-hit wonder? What's that?  

Well, a musical act goes to the top of the charts with a `catchy` `tune` and meaningless lyrics.  
> 음, `기억하기 쉬운 곡조`와 의미없는 가사로 차트의 꼭대기에 올라간 가수들을 말하지.  

I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun!  
> 🎶 난 Lindana야 그리고 행복하고 싶어! 🎶

Then they throw a big diva tantrum, lose their label, then `faded` to `obscurity`.  
> `무명`으로 `사라지다`  

Before they know it, the song ends up as elevator music.  
> 그들이 알기전에, 그 노래는 엘리베이터 음악으로 끝나지.  

Years later they have a reunion concert,  
And after that, they never sing again.  
**And no one remembers them.**  
> 몇년뒤에 재결합 콘서트를 가졌었지,  
> 그리고 그 후에, 그들은 그 노래를 전혀 부르지 않았지.  
> 그리고 아무도 기억하지 못하지..  
>> them 발음(엄 으로 해버림) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaveTiMgr8M&t=20s  

**Not that I would know anything about that.**  
> 내가 그걸 다 안다는건 아니야.  

A one-hit wonder  
> 히트곡이 하나뿐인 가수.  

Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.  
> Ferb, 난 우리가 오늘 뭐해야 할지 알았어.  

Stacy, what am I going to sing?!  
> Stacy, 나 뭐 부르지?  

Hello, what are you gonna wear?  
> 야, 너 뭐 입을건데?  

What do you think?  
> 어때?  

Too much.  
> 너무 과해  

**Too little.**  
> 너무 부족(?)해.  

Ugh, too clean.  
> 어, 너무 깔끔해  

Too dirty.  
> 너무 더러워  

Too street.  
> 너무 스트릿패션이야  

Too goth.  
> 너무 고스같아  

Where did you get that?  
> 그거 어디서 났어?  

My mom's closet.  
Do you like it?  
> 엄마 옷장에서.  
> 맘에 들어?  

Nah, too retro.  
> 아니, 너무 복고풍이야.  

Perfect!  
> 완벽해!  

Nice, huh?  
> 괜찮아?  

Yeah, **you should've tried that on first.**  
> 응, 그걸 처음에 입었어야지  

Let's go!  
> 가자!  

Chicka, Chicka, Chew.  
Wha, meaningless lyrics done.  
**How's the catchy tune `coming along`?**  
> 치카, 치카, 츄.  
> 와, 의미없는 가사 완성.  
> 기억하기 쉬운 음은 `어떻게 되가`?  

Excenllent!  
We'll be done by lunch.  
> 완벽해!  
> 우린 점심시간 까지 끝낼꺼야.  

Hey, where'd Perry go?   
> 어, Perry는 어디갔어?  
>> Where did Perry go?  

Hello, Hello~~  
Anybody there?  
Oh! Good morning, Agent P.  
> 여보세요, 여보세요~~  
> 아무도 없어요?  
> 오! 좋은아침이야 에이전트 P.  

We need you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it.  

Perry!  

**We'll `meet back` in the entrance `in an hour`.**  
> `한시간 뒤에` 입구에서 `다시 만나`.

Come on, Stacy. 
**We gotta hurry** so we can get a spot in li -yayaya..    

**I've never sang in front of so many people.**  
> have sung은 very common non-standard construction라고 한다..  
> 사투리라고..?  

Oh, Candace?  

Huh! I can't do this.  

Oh, yes you can!  
You're not a quitter, you're a fighter.  

I am?  

Sure, you are!  
You're a `lean, mean, singing machine`.  
>> 뭔가 강하고 효율적인걸 나타낼 때 사용함  
>> lean, mean XXX machine 의 형태로 사용함  

That's it! Yeah!  
**Now you're looking like a winner!**  

Hey, Candace.  

And that it's what a gorilla looks like when you try to take away its food.  

Oh, Hi Jeremy! Are you auditioning too?  

Nah, **I came to see this hot new band called PFT.**  

I downloaded their song this morning, it's tight!  

A hundredth contestant gets to sing onstage with the band.  

Really?  

Hey, **looks like that's you.**  

Conguraturations! You're the hundredth contestant!  

Ladies and gentlemen, this young lady has the `honor` of singing onstage with PFT.  
> 신사 숙녀 여러분, 이 어린 소녀가 PTF와 함께 무대에서 노래할 `영광`을 가졌습니다!  

So now, **the band you've been waiting for is Phineas and the Ferb Tones!**  
>> [현재완료 진행](http://hieugene92.tistory.com/entry/have-pp-have-been-pp-have-been-ing-%EC%B0%A8%EC%9D%B4%EC%A0%90)  
>> 과거부터 지금까지 해왔고, 지금도 하고 있다  

Phineas?  

Candace? You're a hundredth contestant? How `serendipitous`.  
> `우연한 일`이네.  

This'll be like a brother and sister thing.  

Now **I'm assuming you've heard our hit single.**  
I mean, who hasn't? It's a big hit.  

And here's the word, and **don't worry if you get lost.**  

The lyrics are meaningless anyway.  

**I'll point it's your turn.**  

Ladies and gentlemen, the Ferbettes.  
I'm Phineas and ths is Ferb, and we're gonna sing a song.  

Bow, Chicka, Bow-Wow!  
(That's what my baby said)  

Mow-mow-mow!  
(And my heart start pumping!)  

Chicka, Chicka, Chew, Wow!  
Never gonna stop.  
Gitchee, Gitchee, Goo means that I love you.  

I said a Bow, Chicka, Bow-Wow!  
(That's what my baby said)  

Mow-mow-mow.  
(And my heart start pumping!)  

Chicka, Chicka, Chew, Wow!  
Never gonna stop.  
Gitchee, Gitchee, Goo means that I love you.  

I said a Bow, Chicka, Bow-wow!  
Candace!  

Wait a minute, what are you doing?  

**I'm `cuing` you.**  
> 너한테 `신호 주는 중`인데.  

How did you get a hit single?  

Wah, it wasn't easy.  
It took most of the morning and half a dozen phone calls.  

And if you're willing to put in the work..  

That's it! I'm gonna tell mom.  

Okay, **tell her what?**  

Ohh, I'm just gonna tell.  

Gitchee, Gitchee, Goo means that I love you.  

Mom, mom, mom! Mom, you gotta see this.  

**Let me guess**, it's unbelievable.. Whoo!!!  

Come on, come on, come on!!  

Hi, I'm Ben Baxter, Huge-O-Records.  
**Why don't `come by` my office in an hour?**  
And we can talk about your future.  
> 한시간 후에 내 사무실에 `잠깐 들리지` 그래?  

Future? Cool. **He must be a psychic.**  

Come on! Come on! Come on! See!  

There they are onstage!  

Ladies and gentlemen, once again Marty the Rabbit Boy and His Musical Blender! 

Hon, we're getting you an eye exam.  
> 눈 검사 받아야겠네.  

No, no, wait!  

Perry!  

Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! Haha, everything is ready.
