I met my love on it..  

Oh, boy. Did that kid stink or what?  
But maybe you've got what it takes to be!  
> 맙소사, 방금 그 애 냄새나거나 그러지 않았나요?  
> 그치만 아마도 당신은 이게 뭘 의미하는지 알았을 겁니다!  
>> Oh boy == Oh great! / Oh no! / Oh my gosh!  

The next super American pop teen idol star!  
> 차세대 미국 십대 아이돌 스타!  

Auditions open today at the Googleplex Mall in beautiful downtown Denville.  
> 오디션은 Denvil 시내에 있는 Googleplex 몰에서 오늘 열립니다  

Auditions? Today?  
> 오디션? 오늘?  

Yes, today!  
At 2'o clock sharp.  
> 네, 오늘요!  
> 2시 정각입니다.  

I gotta tell Stacy!  
> Stacy한테 말해야곘어!  

_That_ pop start _stuff_ might be fun at first.  
But then you'd be _stuck with_ a _dead and job_.  


_Too bad you can't just do it once_ and move on.  

_Well, what_ you're talking about is _one-hit wonder_.  
> 히트곡이 하나뿐인 가수  

A one-hit wonder? What's that?  

Well, a musical act goes to the top of the charts with a `catchy` tune and meaningless lyrics.  
> 기억하기 쉬운  

I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun!  

Then they throw a big diva tentrum, lose their label, then faded to obscurity.  
> 무명으로 사라지다  

_Before they know it, the song ends up as_ elevator music.  

Here's ladies and reunion concert,  
And after that, they never sing again.  
And no one remembers them.  
> them 발음(엄 으로 해버림) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaveTiMgr8M&t=20s  

Not that I would know anything about that.  
> 내가 그걸 안다는건 아니고.  

A one-hit wonder  

Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.  

Stacy, what am I going to sing?!  

Hello, what are you gonna wear?  

What do you think?  

Too much.  
Too little.
Ugh, too clean.
Too dirty.
Too street.
Too goth.  

Where did you get that?  

My mom's closet.  
Do you like it?  

Nah, too retro.  
> 아니, 너무 복고풍이야.  

Perfect!  

Nice, huh?  

Yeah, you should've tried that on first.  

Let's go!  

Chicka, Chicka, Chew.  
Wha, meaningless lyrics done.  
How's the catchy tune coming alone?  
> 기억하기 쉬운 음은 어떻게 되가?  

Excenllent!  
We'll be done by lunch.  
> 우린 점심시간 까지 끝낼꺼야.  

Hey, where'd Perry go?   
>> Where did Perry go?  

Hello, Hello~~  
Anybody there?  
Oh! Good morning, Agent P.  

We need you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it.  

Perry!  

We'll meet back in the entrance in an hour.
