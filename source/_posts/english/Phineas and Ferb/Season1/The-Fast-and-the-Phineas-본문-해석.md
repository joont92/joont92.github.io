So Ferb, what should we do today?  
I mean, `besides` giving Perry a bath.

What is that wonderful noise?  

Awesome!  
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!  

I've got to take a new picture myself for my blog.  
I didn't realize mine is already week old.  

That's better.  

What are you doing to mom's car!!  

We `tricked it out`!

You don't even know how to drive.  

Well, duh.  
That's why Ferb built this remote.  

Oh.. `you're so busted`!  
> `너 딱 걸렸어`  

Mom~ mom~ mom~ mom~  
Hmm, where's mom?  

She's playing bridge at Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro's!  

Heh, they won't get away with it this time!  

Oh, Candace. They bobola, how to you time?
