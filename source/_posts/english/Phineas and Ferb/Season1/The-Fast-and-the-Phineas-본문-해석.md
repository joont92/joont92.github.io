So Ferb, what should we do today?  
I mean, `besides` `giving Perry a bath`.  
> `~ 외에` `목욕시키다`  

What is that wonderful noise?  

Awesome!  
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!  

I've got to take a new picture myself for my blog.  
**I didn't realize mine is already a week old.**  
>> a week old : 일주일 된  
>> It was only a week old.  
>> This paper's a week old.  
>> three five-week-old lion cubs.  

That's better.  

What are you doing to mom's car!!  

We `tricked it out`!  
> 치장하다  

**You don't even know how to drive.**  

Well, duh.  
**That's why Ferb built this remote.**  

Oh.. `you're so busted`!  
> `너 딱 걸렸어`  

Mom~ mom~ mom~ mom~  
Hmm, where's mom?  

She's playing bridge at Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro's!  

Heh, they won't get away with it this time!  

Oh, Candace. dear bubule.  
how to good to see you?  
**What a `coincidence`**, Do you know your mom is here?  
> `우연의 일치`  
    
I do Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro.  
**I need to talk to her `if you don't mind`.**  
> `괜찮으시다면`  

Oi bey, **look how tall you are now.**  
**You must've grown a couple of inchies since last time I saw you.**

That was last week, Mrs.Garcia-Shapiro.  

Well, your mom's inside, dear.  
Where are your `braces`?  
I thought you were wearing braces.  
> `교정기` 

Yeah, mom! Mom! Mom!  

What is it Candace?  

You've got to see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!  

Hey, Ferb. What's the red button for?  

Mom!!!!!!!!!  

What is it?  
**What do you want me to see?**  
>> A가 ~ 하기를  

Quick!!  

Hi, mom~  

Hi, boys~  
Well, **if that's all I'll just be getting back to the game.**  

**Good thing we've `beefed up` the `suspension`.**

Hi, Phinease.  

Oh, hi, Isabella.  

What'cha doin?  

We're entering the Swap Oil 500 today.  

Aren't you gonna need a pit crew?  

Do you know pit crew?

Great, you're hired.  
See at the track.
