### 본문
> **Conan** :  
There must be people that come up to you with Thor jokes, all the times.  
Just because you're so, you're Thor.  

> **Chris** :  
You get the same joke, pretty much.  
In fact, the single same joke that I've had for three years now.  
It is not very funny. But I can tell it to you if you want.  

> **Conan** :  
You're in the right show. trust me.  

> **Chris** :  
So, basically Thor meets this young maiden.  
And they sleep with one another, and have a wonderful night.  
And the next morning Thor says,   
"Fair maiden, I must confess and tell you who I am. I'm Thor."  
And she said,  
"You're Thor? I can hardly walk."  
...  
Very generous audience.  

> **Conan** :  
Nice! That timinig on that was perfect!  

> **Chris** :  
About 60 seconds off there.  

> **Conan** :  
I like long pause.  
So, how many time have you heard that joke?  
People have said that to you.  

> **Chris** :  
I reckon about 300 times. I swear to God.  

> **Conan** :  
I gotta use that one. That's good.  
...  
You know, so much the fans,  
I mean, the reaction of the people here when you came out,  
and the fans are so devoted to you and to the films,  
the fan arts, it's so incredible and very silly.  

> **Chris** :  
It is, yeah.  

> **Conan** :  
I was looking it at online.  

> **Chris** :  
It's same thing.  
There's been many crazy fan arts reproductions of certain things involved with the Thor...  

> **Conan** :  
I think we have some. There's Thoreal.  
That's a really good one.  

> **Chris** :  
That's my hair commercial.  

> **Conan** :  
You shoud try and get that ad. There's Thor De France.  
Very nice.  
And There's Pathor. Very nice.  
...  
That's my favorite so far.  

> **Chris** :  
That one was actually me. That was me.  

> **Conan** :  
You will get hair ad.  
I'm sure they are coming to you and asking.  
Have you ever seen.. because Holloween, a couple days ago.  
Have you ever run into an adult of kid dressed as Thor and had to deal with them?  

> **Chris** :  
Yeah, a lot of Comi Con conventions and things. you see it.  
But I was at the airport, few weeks ago.  
This little kids was runing aroung in the full Thor outfit.  
He has the hammer, and he's smashing things.  
His mother was there.  
And she came up to me and grabs her son,  
"Look, look, It's Thor. Thor."  
And he looks up and he goes,  
"No, it's not."  
Take off the airport.  
I thing with costume and hair..  

> **Conan** :  
Yeah, and then he hit you in the knee, at least.
