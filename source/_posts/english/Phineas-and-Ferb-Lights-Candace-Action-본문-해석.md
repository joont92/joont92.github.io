"To think, To dream, Weather 'tis nobler to love, I know not"  
Ah.. the princess sensibility..  
My favorite play..  

Ahhhhh~~  

What is going on of there!!  

Would you `keep it down` out here?  
You guys ruin everything!  
> `조용히좀 해`

I'm trying to practice the art of acting.  

And I will not be `disturbed` by your little movie.  
> `방해받고` 싶지 않다  

Not so little anymore, last week our website got 176,000,000 hits.  

Oh, sorry I'm late.  
They're filming down the street.  

Filming? What? What are they filming?  

A movie version of the play A Princess Sensibilities.  

Huh, I would be perfect for that part.  
I've been practicing it for my drama club all summer.  
I'm gonna get discovered~~  
> 난 발견될거야~~  

That's serendipitous.  
Hey, where's Perry?  

There you are, Mr.P.  
There's something very strange going on with Dr.Doofenshmirtz.  

He's been very quiet lately  
A little too quiet.  

I want you to find out what's not going on  
and the... put a stop do it  
I suppose. Good luck, Agent.P  

Huh! There it is!  
> 오! 있다!  

Uh.. Execuse me? Mr.Producer?  

I can't talk to you right now, my lead actress just quit!  

Well, sir. This is your lucky day!  

"To think, To drean, Whether 'tis obler to love, I know not"  

Huh, that's not bad  
And you know your line  
Hmm.. I don't know  

I'll do it for free.  

You're hired.  

Really?  

You bet! With the money I save I'll be able to hire the hottest new directors in town.  
Hello?  

Wow, I could get used to this.  

Miss Candace, here's your contract and your bagel.  
This is Antoine, your dialog coach, Nikki, your swimming stand-in, and your personal trainers Olga and Chicago Joe.  
Charmed, I'm sure.  
Drop and give me 20!   

Candace, baby!  
Let me introduct you to the directors of this film.  

Hi, Candace.  

Phineas? And Ferb?  

What are you doing here?  

We're directing the movie.  

Our new agent `arraged` whole thing.  
> 마련했어  

Look, my client get 3% of gross, and a piece of the back end, or he walks.  

Yeah, that's right.  
You mess with the bull, you get the horns, buddy.  
> 그래, 맞아  
> 넌 황소를 건드렸고, 혼쭐이 날거야, 친구.  
>> If you provoke somebody, you can expect an aggressive reaction.

Hello? Syd, baby.  
You got that 3rd act in line yet.  

Wait, wait!  
Don't you think they're little to be big-budget movie directors?  
With 176,000,000 hits, They could be in diapers for all I care.
