Sweet ride.  

> **Po** :  
Oh! Dad what are you doing? We are not supposed to touch anything.  

> **Po's dad** :  
Oh, sorry, sorry. Should I put it back?  

> **Po** :  
Yeah, you probably should.  
You look so cool though.  

> **Po's dad** :  
Yeah, It's pretty cool.  
Oh, what this does. I should pull it.  

> **Po** :  
I think I just a peed a little.

It opens in a week from friday.  

> **Jack** :  
That is Brian Chrinstan plays my dad.  

> **Jimmy** :  
Oh, your dad is Brian Chrinstan?  

> **Jack** :  
Yes.  

> **Jimmy** :  
How can your children not wanna sit next to you,  
their dad is Kung Fu Panda for god's sake.  

> **Jack** :  
It's a mysterious. I don't know.  

> **Jimmy** :  
When you go on a trip, do you have to bring them toys?  
Do you do that thing where you bring them stuff back?  

> **Jack** :  
I do. It makes up for my lack of parenting when I was out of town.  
I come back with gift to let them know I was thinking of them.  
And when I was in China, I wend to Chinese toy store  
and I was like  
"Well, these are all the toys they have in America. They are all made in China"  
But they were like little fresher.  
It's couple weeks in advance.  
They get the prototype earlier.  

> **Jimmy** :  
Still warm, a little bit of softness still.  

> **Jack** :  
Do you know what was lame?  
As I looked at all the toys, and I was like  
"I'm gonna buy them Kung Fu Panda toys."  
It's so dumb.  

> **Jimmy** :  
Oh, you did?  

> **Jack** :  
I should get those for free.  
But they seemd like best toys there.  

> **Jimmy** :  
You don't get those for free?  

> **Jack** :  
Yeah, No one sent me a basket of free toys.  

> **Jimmy** :  
Oh wow, that's a tragedy. It really is.
