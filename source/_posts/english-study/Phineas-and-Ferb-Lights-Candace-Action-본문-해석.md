"To think, To dream, Weather 'tis nobler to love, I know not"  
Ah.. the princess sensibility..  
My favorite play..  

Ahhhhh~~  

What is going on of there!!  

Would you `keep it down` out here?  
You guys ruin everything!  
> `조용히좀 해`

I'm trying to practice the art of acting.  

And I will not be `disturbed` by your little movie.  
> `방해받고` 싶지 않다  

Not so little anymore, last week our website got 176,000,000 hits.  

Oh, sorry I'm late.  
They're filming down the street.  

Filming? What? What are they filming?  

A movie version of the play A Princess Sensibilities.  

Huh, I would be perfect for that part.  
I've been practicing it for my drama club all summer.  
I'm gonna get discovered~~  
> 난 발견될거야~~  
>> <http://blog.naver.com/PostView.nhn?blogId=bosangmaster&logNo=221110252654&parentCategoryNo=&categoryNo=61&viewDate=&isShowPopularPosts=true&from=search>  

That's serendipitous.  
Hey, where's Perry?  

There you are, Mr.P.  
There's something very strange going on with Dr.Doofenshmirtz.  

He's been very quiet lately  
A little too quiet.  

I want you to find out what's not going on  
and the... put a stop do it  
I suppose. Good luck, Agent.P  

Huh! There it is!  
> 오! 있다!  

Uh.. Execuse me? Mr.Producer?  

I can't talk to you right now, my lead actress just quit!  

Well, sir. This is your lucky day!  

"To think, To drean, Whether 'tis obler to love, I know not"  

Huh, that's not bad  
And you know your line  
Hmm.. I don't know  

I'll do it for free.  

You're hired.  

Really?  

You bet! With the money I save I'll be able to hire the hottest new directors in town.  
Hello?  

Wow, I could get used to this.  
>> <https://ilikeen.tistory.com/207>  

Miss Candace, here's your contract and your bagel.  
This is Antoine, your dialog coach, Nikki, your swimming stand-in, and your personal trainers Olga and Chicago Joe.  
Charmed, I'm sure.  
Drop and give me 20!   

Candace, baby!  
Let me introduct you to the directors of this film.  

Hi, Candace.  

Phineas? And Ferb?  

What are you doing here?  

We're directing the movie.  

Our new agent `arraged` whole thing.  
> 마련했어  

Look, my client get 3% of gross, and a piece of the back end, or he walks.  

Yeah, that's right.  
You mess with the bull, you get the horns, buddy.  
> 그래, 맞아  
> 넌 황소를 건드렸고, 혼쭐이 날거야, 친구.  
>> If you provoke somebody, you can expect an aggressive reaction.

Hello? Syd, baby.  
You got that 3rd act in line yet.  

Wait, wait!  
Don't you think they're little to be big-budget movie directors?  
With 176,000,000 hits, They could be in diapers for all I care.

Phineas, I don't remember any monsters in the Princess Sensibility.  

We just finished the rewrites this morning.  

The curse of the princess monsters?  

That is not what I signed up for,  
Besides, I can't wear this.  
No one will see my face.  

Yeah, but in the end, the curse is lifted!  
And in your big dramatic scene, you will look `stunning`!  
This film could make you a star..  
> `굉장히 아름다운(멋진`  

Really?  
Uh.. uh.. star..?  

Hey, ugly monster.  
You're needed on the set.  

I~~'m comming~~  

Perry the platypus?  
Why do you keep breaking down my doors?  

Why don't you knock first? It's not even locked!  
This time, you'll pay.  
That's right, `fork it over`.  
> 그거야, `지불해`.  

 What? Are you kidding me?  
 This isn't just drywall, you know.  
 It's solid oak.  

**That's more like it!**  
> 그래 그거야, 그게 훨씬 낫다  

You can't just go `busting` into people's houses for no reason, you know.  
> 너는 이유없이 사람들의 집을 부수고 갈 수 없어, 알다시피  
> 꺠 부수다  

Besides, I've given up evil to pursue the art of cheese making.  

Do you like stinky Limburger?  
It's a Doofenshmirtz family recipe.  

It's not ready yet.  
It still has to age for 58 and 1/2 years.  
> 아직 58년 반동안 나이를 먹어야 한다  

But who's got that kind of time?  
Which is why, I created, The Age Accelerator Inator.  
>> <https://www.myenglishteacher.eu/ask/question/which-is-why-or-that-is-why/>  

Okay, Candace.  
This is very important scene.  
It is `nothing less than` emotional backbone of the whole film.  
> 다름 아닌 바로

Oh, and the villagers are coming at you with everything they've got.  
> 오, 그리고 마을 사람들이 그들이 가진 모든것을 들고 너한테 덤벼들고 있어  

Oh, what do you mean the villagers..  

Action!  
The airport!  

Beautiful! That's a print!  
Oh, that's a little embarrasing.  

Wow! Is this banana hat for some cool tropical dance number?  

We're trying to come up with some exciting camera angles for the big chase scene.  
So we strapped a camera on to this starving monkey.  

Aah! Get away!  
Sorry that monkey cam didn't work out.  

We're gonna try it with Ferb this time.
Now take this sandwich and remember, Ferb hasn't eaten lunch yet.  

Hold on tight.

Okay.  
In this scene, the monster, that's you  
gets attacked by 800 cubic feet of rats, spiders, and snakes.  

There is no way I am doing that!  

Relax, they're made out of rubber.  

Well the snakes are rubber, anyway.  

AAH! Get em' off me! Get em' off me!  
> 떼어내!  

Okay. Candace, this is your beauty shot.  
The curse has been lifted, and you're no longer a monster.  
And this scene, it's all about what the heart wants, but the mind can't have.  
Take one.  
> 저주가 풀렸고, 

"To dream, To be free of the curse.."  

Beautiful. Keep going.  
Cue the magical girly dust!  

"Whether 'tis nobler to be loved"  

Cue wind machine.  



Cut the wind machine!  

Okay. Drop the flower `petals`.  
> 꽃잎  

"Whether 'tis nobler.."  

Wrong `prop`.  
What the heck, let's keep it!  
> 잘못된 소품이야  
> 에라 모르곘다, 그냥 하자!  

Okay, people.  
That's a wrap.  

Here's your big dramatic scene, Candace.  

Huh,huh.. "To think, To dream.."  

Cut!  

Uh? Oh, I'm sorry.  

Do it again.  

"To think, to.. to.. think, To dream.."  

That's a horrible.  
I can't let anybody see this!  

That's what's called rough cut.  

Ferb's gonna fix it in editing.  
`Tighten up `the `dialog`.  
Do a little voice `modulation`.  
Play with the filter~  
And now take a look!  
> `엄격해지다` `대화`  
> `조절`  

"To think, To dream, To be free of the curse"  
I.. I.. I look beautiful!  

That's what they call, the movie magic.  

You two are the best brothers a great actress could ever have!
