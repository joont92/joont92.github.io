10 Second Trivia. The world's highest peak, Mt. Everest `is named for whom`?  
> 누구에 의해 이름이 지어졌나?  

A British surveyor, a New Zealand mountaineer, an American explorer or an Australian geographer.  

Sir George Everest or Everest was a British surveyr who helped map India but Mt. Everest is named for him.  

It was New Zealand Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepal's Tenzing Norgay who became the first climbers `recognized for reaching Everest's summit`.  
> 에베레스트 정상에 오른것으로 알려진  

Since they did that in 1953, several thousand other climbers have reached the mountain top.  

Several hundred people have died on the mountain.  

That included 11 mountaineers who died in this year's climbing season making it one of the deadliest seasons on Everest.  

May is considered the best time to climb the mountain because the weather's usually a little better and the winds aren't as extreme as in other months.  

But a mountain guide told CNN that this year's weather hasn't been great and that `it's left a limited window of days that are good for climbing`.  
> 등반하기 좋은 날들이 제한되어 있다  

`Combine that with overcrowding on the mountain, a number of inexperienced climbers, and some expedition companies that may not be prioritizing safety and` you have the reasons why climbers say it's been particularly dangerous in 2019.
