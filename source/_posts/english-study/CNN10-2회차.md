It's being called a cold war in tech:  
The White House essentially blacklisting the second-largest smart phone maker in the world, China's `crown jewel` of high technology, Huawei, `a symbol of the Chinese government's strategy to dominate high tech`.  
> 수익성이나 성장성이 매우 높은 사업을 말함  
> 고급 기술을 지배하려는 중국 전략의 상징인  

It opens a new front `in President Trump's trade war with China`, `barring Huawei from buying or licensing American parts`, with `ripple effects` through global supply chains.  
> 트럼프 대통령의 대중 무역전쟁`에서`
> 화웨이가 미국 부품들을 사거나 라이센스를 취득하는것을 금지하면서  
> 파급 효과

American chipmakers can no longer sell to the Chinese without U.S. government licenses.  

Google has suspended updates for Android phones made by Huawei.  

The U.S. says isolating Huawei is a matter of national security.  

China says it is a victim of U.S. bullying.  

Now the `Commerce Department` issued limited exemptions for Huawei products, but the `new tough strategy of confronting China` `remains in place` overall.  
> 미국 상무부  
> 중국과 맞서는 새로운 강력한 전략  
> 제자리에 남아있다  

But the NASDAQ `is still up this year an impressive amount`.  
> 여전히 인상깊은 양으로 올라가고 있다  

And even with tariffs and counter-tariffs, the NASDAQ is still higher than it was when the trade war began last summer, a testament to the resilience of stocks `and at the same time`, `a reminder of the risk to the down side`.  
> ~이자 동시에
> 아래쪽의 위험에 `대한` 신호

Now President Trump wants China to play fair.  

He wants China to stop stealing intellectual property from American companies and `unfairly subsidizing its strategic industries`.  
> 불공정하게 그것의 전략 산업 보조금을 지불하는 것

`And he has more leverage to use`.  
> 그리고 그는 좀 더 유리하다(사용할 방법이 더 많아서)  
>> 불리하다 : don't have any leverage  

The White House preparing even more tariffs, affecting American products made in China, `on everything from iPhones to sneakers`.  
> 모든것에 대해(아이폰부터 운동화까지)

Ten Second Trivia.  
In the 1630s, Holland saw a market boom and bust `centered on what flower`: Rose, Tulip, Lotus or Poppy?  
> 어떤 꽃에 집중되었나?  

Holland's `17th century frenzy was called tulip craze or tulip mania`.  
> 17세기 광분은 튤립 열풍이나 튤립 열광이라고 불렸다

Here's how that happened. Tulips from Turkey were introduced to the Dutch in the 1500s.  

They were popular and in high demand, `so the price shot up`.  
> 그래서 가격이 급증했다

`Rare color patterns of tulips drove that price even higher`, so much so that `people started mortgaging their homes and estates` to get bulbs that they hope to then `resell at a profit`.  
> 희귀한 튤립 색상은 그 가격을 훨씬 높였다  
> 사람들은 그들의 집과 땅을 저당잡히기 시작했다  
> 이익을 남기고 팔고 싶어한다

But the flower fades.  
> 그러나 꽃은 희미(시들)해진다

In 1637, some began to doubt that they really would make more money on tulips, and they started selling them. 

Others followed.  

The tulip craze `suddenly came crashing down`.  
> 갑자기 무너졌다

Entire fortunes were lost, and `the event stands a reminder today` about the risk of speculative investments.  
> 그 사건은 오늘날 ~를 상기시킨다

`What better place to discuss this then at the world's largest flower auction`, a place not far from Amsterdam, where tens of millions of plants are traded everyday.  
> 이것에 대해 토의할 수 있는 장소는 세계에서 가장 큰 꽃 경매장이다
